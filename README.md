Molecular dynamics

Argon gas

Assignment:
In this project, you write a molecular dynamics (MD) code which simulates an argon gas. The user of your programme should be able to specify density and temperature, and extract useful quantities for these parameters, such as pressure, correlation function, diffusion constant, specific heat.

Other options are to keep the pressure constant, (NPT ensemble) or to calculate the chemical potential using Widom's particle insertion method.

All calculated quantities are subject to statistical fluctuations. You should estimate the statistical error.
